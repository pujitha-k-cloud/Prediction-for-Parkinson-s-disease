## 📘 Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.  
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on vocal features and medical indicators.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a predictive model that classifies patients as **Parkinson’s Positive** or **Negative** with high accuracy, using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** as the primary algorithm.

---

## ⚙️ Approach

1. **Data Understanding:**  
   The dataset contains biomedical voice measurements from healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize numerical features  
   - Encode categorical values if required  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Implemented several algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
   - Selected **SVM** for its high accuracy in medical classification problems  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal results  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Visualized confusion matrix and ROC curve  

---

## 🧪 Results
- **Best Performing Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~95% (varies by parameter tuning)  
- SVM handled high-dimensional, non-linear data effectively.  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Voice analysis provides strong indicators for early Parkinson’s detection.  
- Machine learning can complement clinical diagnosis to assist healthcare professionals.  
- Continuous improvement in dataset diversity and feature engineering can further enhance predictive reliability.
