##  Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.  
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on vocal features and medical indicators.

---

##  Objective
Develop a predictive model that classifies patients as **Parkinson’s Positive** or **Negative** with high accuracy, using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** as the primary algorithm.

---

##  Approach

1. **Data Understanding:**  
   The dataset contains biomedical voice measurements from healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize numerical features  
   - Encode categorical values if required  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Implemented several algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
   - Selected **SVM** for its high accuracy in medical classification problems  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal results  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Visualized confusion matrix and ROC curve  

---

##  Results
- **Best Performing Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~95% (varies by parameter tuning)  
- SVM handled high-dimensional, non-linear data effectively.  

---

##  Key Insights
- Voice analysis provides strong indicators for early Parkinson’s detection.  
- Machine learning can complement clinical diagnosis to assist healthcare professionals.  
- Continuous improvement in dataset diversity and feature engineering can further enhance predictive reliability.  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

--- 

## Ethical Note
This model is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
Always consult medical professionals for diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease.

## TRY ON FROM YOUR SIDE
I am uploading a sample data,to check on the code
    [160.0,210.0,100.0,0.0105,0.00008,0.005,0.0055,0.015,0.035,0.300,0.020,0.025,0.030,0.065,0.050,18.0,0.62,0.75,-4.9,0.30,2.35,0.45]
   This is the sample data , add these features to check the output and make it more intresting by adding new things..
                         ----HAPPY CODING-----
